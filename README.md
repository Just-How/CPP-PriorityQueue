# CPP-PriorityQueue

A C++ program to check to see if a hypothetical door is open or closed after a sequence of events using a priority queue.

This program should read the instructions in addition to the priority of each instruction from an input file. It should then load each instruction into a priority queue where the instructions are sorted by their priority. Finally, it should follow the sequence of instructions and output “the door is closed” or “the door is opened”.
